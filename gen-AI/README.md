### To demonstrate how we can use Harness AI to write an Application and its pipeline.

## Steps:

- A repository is created where we will select the appropriate .gitignore file as per the technology.

- Clone the repo, we'll need to authenticate while cloning. Provide Hanress username and generate clone credential and paste the API token as password. Repo will be clonewd with .gitignore and README.md files present in it.

- Now we can use the AIDA code generation extension to write our application. Create a new file, let say "app.py" and ask AIDA to generate the app. Provide the description like in the screenshot below.
