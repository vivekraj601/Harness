# Harness AIDA Cloud Cost Optimization
This is a tool designed to help organizations monitor, analyze, and reduce cloud spending across various cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. It provides real-time insights, cost forecasting, anomaly detection, and automated governance to optimize resource utilization.

### Key Features:
- Anomaly Detection – Identifies unusual spikes in cloud costs using AI/ML.
- Auto-Stopping – Automatically shuts down idle cloud resources to reduce waste.
- Budgeting & Forecasting – Predicts future cloud costs and helps enforce budget limits.
- Multi-Cloud Support – Works across AWS, GCP, and Azure to provide a unified cost view.


### Intelligent Auto-Stopping:
Uses AI to analyze usage patterns and automatically shut down idle VMs, containers, and databases when not in use.
Adapts schedules dynamically based on actual workload behavior.
Prevents zombie instances from running in the background (resources left running accidentally).
