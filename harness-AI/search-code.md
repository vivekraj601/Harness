## Search your code with AIDA

This feature of Harness AI Development Assistant (AIDA) allows developers to quickly find and understand code across their repositories. It provides an AI-powered, context-aware search capability that helps users locate specific functions, variables, or logic without manually scanning large codebases.</br>
</br>
It uses the Semantic Code Search functionality to search your entire codebase using natural language queries. Ask a question and let AIDA retrieve source code that best answers your question. This is useful when you aren't sure what specific keywords to search for or you want to better understand what the code achieves.
